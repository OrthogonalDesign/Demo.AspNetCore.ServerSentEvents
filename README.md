# Demo.AspNetCore.ServerSentEvents

Application for demonstrating functionality of [Lib.AspNetCore.ServerSentEvents](https://github.com/tpeczek/Lib.AspNetCore.ServerSentEvents).

The application exposes two SSE endpoints:
* `/see-heartbeat` which can be "listened" by navigating to `/sse-heartbeat-receiver.html`. It sends an event every 5s and is implemented through an ugly background thread.
* `/sse-notifications` which can be "listened" by navigating to `/notifications/sse-notifications-receiver`. Sending events to this endpoint can be done by navigating to `/notifications/sse-notifications-sender`.

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tpeczek).
